This was for running it locally now if you want to run it on the server use the URL https://afternoon-forest-80014-a709e9a11c54.herokuapp.com/

in this way you can directly see the application on the browser and for the pipeline to work there should be a change added or pushed to the github repository
as soon as there is a change in the github repo the pipeline will build and the tests will run and the app will get deployed on to the heroku platform with the fresh code implemenatation.
